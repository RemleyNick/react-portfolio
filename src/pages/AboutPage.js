                        Exercise can be time consuming and gym memberships can
                        be expensive. If those barriers are not big enough, how

                        barriers and have you taking steps forward towards a
                        pain-free you! Play an active role in reducing your
                        short and long-term pain with these quick exercises,
                        customized based on your daily pain rating.
